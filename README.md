# ImageProcessingInMATLAB

mage processing is the process of manipulating the digital properties of an image to improve its quality or to get the desired information from the image. It entails importing the image in the image processing application, analyzing the image, then manipulating the image to get a suitable output that can produce desired results.
Digital image processing algorithms can be used to:
1) Improve clarity, and remove noise and other artifacts
2) Extract the size, scale, or number of objects in a scene
3) Prepare images for display or printing
4) Compress images for communication across a network
